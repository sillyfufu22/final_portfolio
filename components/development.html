                    Being a student from Myanmar, there are times when I crave the taste of home and wish there was a Burmese restaurant in Providence. So when this assignment came up, I decided to make an interactive interface using React to create a Burmese online food ordering website called Mandalay! I thought this was also a way to introduce Burmese cuisine to the Brown community and an opportunity for people to learn more about food from home.

                    I started off my project with a research on traditional Burmese food since I am curating a selection of various types of food to present to my audience. I divided my food selection into two categories: course and diet. For course, I added appetizers, main courses, and desserts. For diet, I added vegan, vegetarian, and meat selections. Since I am also intending for this website as a place for people to learn more about Burmese food, I also added detailed food description describing what the food contains, how it is prepared, and a little background history on the food.

                <p class="big_p">
                    To aid with the design and layout of the website, I explored existing online Burmese food ordering websites. A few samples are shown below.

                <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
                <p class="big_p">
                    I started my design process with finding food pictures that were cohesive to one another so that the website looks uniform. Since this is a food website with a Burmese theme, I went for a goldish-bronze color palette that reminds me of Bagan, a well-known ancient town in Myanmar. To cater to the needs of website users, I set up two filtering catergories: course and diet. There is also a sorting function by price. Each food item displays:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Image</li>
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Course</li>
                        <li>Diet</li>
                        <li>Food Description</li>
                        <li>Price</li>
                        <li>Add to Cart Button</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="big_p">
                    The filtering and sorting buttons are at the top because that is where users would expect to find them and each food item has a similar display for memorability.
                </p>

                <p class="big_p">
                    There is also a shopping cart section that displays:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Items added to the cart</li>
                        <li>Quantity of each item</li>
                        <li>Price of each item</li>
                        <li>Add/Remove item buttons</li>
                        <li>Total price of the cart</li>

                    This project was really fun and enjoyable and reminded me so much of home. I learned things that I never knew about the food that I have been eating since I was a kid and hopefully I can share this knowledge with my peers as well! In terms of technical knowledge, this was my first time using React so it took quite some time for me to get used to components and props but it made me appreciate more for the moments when my code works!
